This project should demonstrate my understanding of basic HTML. 

This includes: 
1. HTML file configuration
2. Directory use to manage site files
3. Text maniuplation including headings, paragraphs, strong, and emphasized text
4. Ordered and unordered lists
5. Absolute and relative links
6. Inclusion of images and linked images with alt text and size adjustments where neeeded
7. Use of git for version control, special emphasis on commit messages


This project also is a baseline for futher work with CSS once I progress to those lessons.
